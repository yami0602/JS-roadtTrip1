// Build a trainCapacity variable and set it to 40. Then create a numPassengers
// variable and store the number 4 in it. Lastly, construct a string
// called occupancy in the following format:
//
//    "4 passengers present. with 36 seats remaining."
//
// In the console, use numPassengers to find the number of passengers
// on the bus, and use (trainCapacity - numPassengers) to find the number
// of seats remaining. Then log occupancy to the console.

const trainCapcity = 40
const numPassengers = 4


const occupaancy = `${numPassengers} passengers present. with  ${trainCapcity-numPassengers} seats remaining`
console.log(occupaancy)
